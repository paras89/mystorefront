README:


1. Setup your local host to point at www.mystorefront.com
2. Create database : mystorefront_magento and import the sql dump from the location: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qrxsfaqe7mhfcti/mystorefront_magento.sql?m
3. The Dump already has the products from the catalog csv imported.


Steps to create the solution: 

1. First the categories were imported and set up from the CSV file; to do this a shell script : shell/import_categories.php was created.
2. Then the products were imported and set up from the CSV file, shell script : shell/import_products.php was used.
3. For each Group ID a corresponding configurable product was created, while the versions under one group id were associated
   as simple products with the particular configurable product.
4. On the Search results page simple products that have configurable products won't show up; this was ahichieved by controlling the visiblity attribute of these products.
5. The configurable Product PDP pages will show all the simple product values.


This solution can act as an Independent Magento product import module/(shell scripts) if the format in which the catalog is provided is like in the csv provided.
